First, Maya woke up in her bed. The sun was coming through her window, just like always. Then, Maya put on her blue shirt and her blue pants. She put on her left shoe, then her right shoe. Everything was in the right place.

First, Maya ate her breakfast. She ate one piece of toast, two apple slices, and drank three sips of water. Then, she brushed her teeth for two minutes, just like always. Finally, Maya was ready to visit the ocean path.

First, Maya walked to her front door. Then, she opened the door and stepped outside. The weather was sunny and warm, the same as last time. Finally, Maya started walking down the path because she wanted to see the ocean.

First, Maya counted her steps on the path. One, two, three, four, five steps. Then, she counted five more steps. One, two, three, four, five. Finally, Maya reached the garden next to the path.

First, Maya kept walking on the path. Then, she saw a bridge ahead. The bridge was made of wood and it was brown, the same as last time. Finally, Maya walked to the bridge because the bridge went over a small stream.

First, Maya stepped onto the bridge. Then, she walked across the bridge slowly. She took one step, then another step, then another step. Finally, Maya reached the other side of the bridge because she had walked all the way across.

First, Maya looked around. Then, she saw a meadow with tall grass. The grass was green and it moved in the wind, just like always. Finally, Maya walked into the meadow because the path went through the meadow.

First, Maya walked down the hill. Then, she took careful steps. One step, then another step, then another step. Finally, Maya reached the bottom of the hill because she had walked all the way down.

First, Maya reached the ground. Then, she walked on the path toward the ocean. The path had sand on it now because the path was getting close to the beach. Finally, Maya could hear the ocean waves.

First, Maya heard the waves. The waves made a soft sound: swoosh, swoosh, swoosh. Then, Maya walked faster because she was excited. Finally, Maya reached the beach.

First, Maya stepped onto the sand. The sand was warm and soft, just like always. Then, Maya took off her left shoe, then her right shoe. Finally, Maya's feet were in the warm sand.
