# The Treehouse Potion-Maker

Mira lived in a treehouse at the edge of the Whispering Woods, and she was almost—*almost*—a real wizard. She had the pointed hat (slightly crooked). She had the spellbook (borrowed from the library). She even had a cauldron (which was really just a big soup pot, but it worked perfectly fine).

What she didn't have was a single friend who believed in magic.

"Magic isn't real," her classmate Jonas had said just that morning. "You're just mixing colored water and pretending."

The words had stung like nettles. Mira climbed the rope ladder to her treehouse now, as the sun painted the sky orange and pink, determined to prove him wrong. Tonight, she would brew a real potion. Not just any potion—the Friendship Flame, a legendary spell she'd discovered in the very back of her spellbook.

The instructions were written in curling silver letters: *To find a friend whose heart is true, the Friendship Flame will guide you.*

She gathered her ingredients carefully. Moonpetal flowers from the garden below—check. Dewdrops from the morning grass—check. A whisper of hope—well, she had plenty of that, even if it was a bit wobbly today.

Mira stirred the cauldron clockwise three times, then counterclockwise twice. The liquid began to glow, soft as candlelight, bright as promise. Her heart hammered with excitement. It was working! It was actually working!

But then the potion began to bubble. And fizz. And—

*Pop!*

A spark shot out of the cauldron, zipped around the treehouse like a confused firefly, and zoomed straight out the window. Mira scrambled down the ladder so fast she nearly forgot to use the rungs at all. The spark was already far ahead, dancing through the twilight like a tiny falling star.

"Wait!" she called. "Come back!"

But the Friendship Flame had other plans.

It led her down the winding path through the woods, where the trees whispered secrets to each other in the breeze. Mira ran, her hat flying off and landing in a bush—no time to retrieve it now. The spark bobbed and weaved between branches, always just out of reach.

She emerged into a meadow she'd never seen before, though she thought she knew every inch of these woods. The grass grew tall and silver in the moonlight, and flowers bloomed in colors that didn't quite have names. The spark danced across the meadow, leaving a trail of glittering light.

"This is impossible," Mira breathed. But she was grinning.

The spark paused at the edge of the meadow, hovering over an old stone bridge that crossed a burbling stream. Mira had definitely never seen this bridge before. It was covered in moss and carved with symbols that looked almost like letters, if you squinted. She stepped onto it carefully, testing each stone.

Beneath her, the water sang. Actually sang—little melodious notes that sounded like "follow, follow, follow."

On the other side of the bridge, the spark zipped up a gentle hill. Mira's legs were getting tired, but curiosity pushed her forward. What was the Friendship Flame trying to show her? At the top of the hill stood a garden unlike any she'd ever imagined.

Vegetables grew in spiral patterns. Flowers bloomed in the shape of stars. And in the very center, tending to a patch of glowing mushrooms, was a boy about her age.

He had dirt on his nose and leaves in his dark curly hair. He was talking to the plants.

"Yes, yes, I know you need more moonlight," he was saying to a drooping fern. "I'll move you tomorrow, I promise. Oh, don't give me that look—you're not the only plant here, you know."

The Friendship Flame zoomed straight to him and circled his head like a crown. The boy looked up, startled, and his eyes met Mira's. They were warm and brown and surprised.

"Um," said Mira. "Hi."

"Hi," said the boy. "Is this yours?" He pointed at the spark.

"Sort of. I mean, yes. I made it. It's a potion. A spell, actually. The Friendship Flame." The words tumbled out in a rush. "I'm Mira. I'm a wizard. Well, almost a wizard. I'm practicing."

The boy's face split into an enormous smile. "You're a wizard? Really? That's amazing! I'm Oliver. I'm a garden mage." He said it proudly, like it was the most natural thing in the world. "I do plant magic. Growing spells, mostly. Sometimes talking-to-vegetables spells, but those are tricky."

Mira felt something warm bloom in her chest, brighter than any potion. "You believe in magic?"

"Believe in it?" Oliver laughed. "I live in it! Here, watch this." He knelt down and whispered something to a patch of bare earth. Immediately, tiny green shoots pushed through the soil, unfurling into delicate flowers that chimed like bells when the breeze touched them.

"That's incredible," Mira whispered.

"Your Friendship Flame is incredible," Oliver countered. "I've read about those in my gran's books. They're supposed to be really difficult to brew. Most wizards can't make them until they're at least thirteen."

"Really?" Mira felt about three inches taller.

The spark had settled now, floating gently between them, pulsing with a soft golden light. Oliver reached out and let it land on his palm. It didn't burn—it felt warm and happy, like holding a purring kitten.

"I think it brought you here," he said quietly. "I've been working in this garden all summer, and I haven't met anyone else who understands magic. Everyone at my school thinks I'm weird because I talk to plants."

"Everyone at my school thinks I'm weird because I try to do spells," Mira said.

They looked at each other and grinned.

"Do you want to see my treehouse?" Mira asked. "I have a whole potion-making station. And about seventeen spellbooks from the library. And I've been trying to figure out a levitation charm for weeks, but I can't get it right."

"Yes!" Oliver jumped up so fast he nearly tripped over a pumpkin vine. "And you have to see my greenhouse—
