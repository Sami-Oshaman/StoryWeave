# Rex's Big Discovery

Rex the T-Rex woke up early. He jumped out of bed fast. Today was adventure day!

"I need to find fossils!" Rex said.

He zoomed down the forest path. His big feet went STOMP STOMP. The ground shook with each step.

What did Rex see ahead?

A wooden bridge crossed the river. Rex ran across it super fast. The bridge went creak, creak, creak!

On the other side was something. It sparkled in the morning sun. Rex found a golden fossil!

"My first treasure!" Rex roared happily.

He put it in his backpack. Then he kept running forward. The path led to a garden.

What was growing in the garden?

Huge purple flowers were everywhere! They were taller than Rex himself. A butterfly zoomed past his nose.

Rex spotted something shiny between flowers. Another fossil was hiding there! This one was silver and smooth.

"Two fossils now!" Rex shouted with joy.

He did a little victory dance. His tail swished back and forth. The flowers wiggled when he moved.

Where should Rex explore next?

He saw a tall treehouse ahead. Rex climbed up the wooden ladder. Each step brought him higher up.

The treehouse had a special telescope. Rex looked through it really carefully. He could see the whole forest!

"There's a meadow over there!" Rex said.

He climbed down a bit slower. His backpack felt heavier now. But Rex was still very excited.

The meadow was soft and green. Butterflies danced in the warm air. Rex walked through the tall grass.

What was that sound he heard?

Chirp, chirp went some baby birds. They were learning to fly today. Rex watched them hop and flutter.

Under a big rock was another fossil! This one looked like a leaf. It was very, very old.

"Three fossils for my collection!" Rex said.

He sat down for a moment. The grass felt nice and cool. Rex took a deep breath in.

The sun was getting lower now. It painted the sky soft orange. Rex felt a little bit tired.

He walked toward the big hill. His steps were slower than before. The hill wasn't too steep today.

What would Rex find at the top?

At the top was the best view. Rex could see his whole adventure. The bridge, garden, treehouse, and meadow.

He sat down on the soft grass. Rex opened his backpack very carefully. All three fossils were still safe.

"I did it," Rex said quietly.

The wind blew gently through his hair. Birds sang their sleepy evening songs. The sky turned pink, then purple.

Rex laid down on the hill. The grass made a cozy bed. His fossils rested beside him safely.

Stars started to appear above him. They twinkled like tiny night lights. Rex counted one, two, three stars.

His eyes felt heavy and warm. His breathing became slow and steady. The whole forest was getting quiet.

"What a good day," Rex whispered softly.

His adventure was complete and wonderful. Tomorrow would bring new exciting things. But right now, rest felt perfect.

Rex closed his eyes very gently. The stars watched over him kindly. The moon smiled down at little Rex.

His fossils were safe in his backpack. His heart was full of happy memories. His body felt relaxed and peaceful.

Rex took one more slow breath. In and out, nice and easy. The forest whispered goodnight to him.

And Rex the T-Rex fell asleep. He dreamed of tomorrow's gentle adventures. Everything was calm, safe, and good.

Goodnight, little dinosaur explorer.

Goodnight.
