# Max's Space Adventure

Max saw a rocket outside.
It was shiny and red.
"Wow!" he said.

The rocket door opened wide.
Max jumped inside super fast!
Buttons were everywhere!

He pressed the big green button.
WHOOSH! The rocket blasted off!
Max zoomed up, up, up!

What do you think happened next?

Stars whizzed past the window.
They sparkled like diamonds.
Max counted ten bright stars!

A purple planet appeared ahead.
It had three giant rings!
Max steered the rocket closer.

"I'm a real astronaut now!"
He did a happy dance.
The rocket spun around twice.

Beep! Beep! A message came in.
Someone needed his help!
Max flew even faster.

Can you guess who called?

A space station floated nearby.
It had blinking blue lights.
Max carefully landed his rocket.

An alien friend waved hello.
Her name was Zara.
She had lost her space dog!

"I'll help you find him!"
Max and Zara searched together.
They looked behind moon rocks.

The space dog wasn't there.
They checked inside the station.
Still no space dog anywhere!

Where could he be hiding?

Max had a smart idea.
He grabbed some space treats.
He shook the treat bag.

Woof! Woof! They heard barking!
The space dog floated over.
He licked Max's helmet happily.

"You found him!" Zara cheered.
She gave Max a gold star.
It glowed in his hand.

Max felt very proud inside.
He earned his astronaut badge too.
What an amazing adventure!

Now it was getting late.
The stars began to dim.
The moon glowed soft and gentle.

Max yawned a big yawn.
Time to fly back home.
He waved goodbye to Zara.

The rocket floated slowly now.
It drifted past quiet planets.
Everything felt peaceful and calm.

Max looked at the moon.
It smiled down at him.
The moon looked sleepy too.

His rocket glided through clouds.
Soft and white and fluffy.
Like floating on cotton candy.

The rocket landed very gently.
Right in Max's backyard.
Home felt warm and cozy.

Max climbed out slowly.
He held his gold star.
His eyes felt heavy now.

He walked to his bedroom.
His bed looked so comfortable.
The pillow was soft and cool.

Max put on his pajamas.
He climbed under the blankets.
They were warm and snuggly.

He looked out his window.
The stars twinkled goodnight to him.
They seemed to say "Sweet dreams."

Max closed his eyes slowly.
He smiled a sleepy smile.
He dreamed of space adventures.

The rocket would wait outside.
Ready for tomorrow's journey.
But tonight, Max needed rest.

His breathing became slow and steady.
In and out, nice and easy.
Max felt safe and peaceful.

The stars watched over him.
The moon kept him company.
Everything was calm and quiet.

Goodnight, brave astronaut Max.
Sleep well under the stars.
Tomorrow brings new adventures.
