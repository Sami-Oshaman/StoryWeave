Rocket Max, the star explorer, saw a shiny red rocket. "Wow!" he said. Rocket soared high. Stars twinkled. Max jumped.

Planet green appeared. "What's that?" he asked. Green planet had tall trees, colorful birds. Max zoomed closer.

Suddenly, a blue planet! It had oceans, beaches. Max wanted to explore. He blasted off, leaving green behind.

Next, a giant planet with stripes. "Stripey!" Max named it. Stars danced around. Max took pictures.

Suddenly, a meteor shower! Max dove. Stars flew past. What a show!

Planet yellow next. It was hot and sandy. Max landed, explored caves. He discovered hidden treasures!

Planet purple was next. It had beautiful flowers. Max picked some, smelled them. They smelled sweet.

Suddenly, the moon! "Hello, moon!" Max said. He landed, hopped around. Moonbeams danced on his helmet.

Next, a space station. "Wow!" Max said. He entered, met friendly astronauts. They shared stories, laughed.

Suddenly, a surprise! A baby alien! Max played, learned its language. They became friends.

Now, Max was tired. Stars twinkled. He looked at his pictures. "What a day!" he thought.

Suddenly, a cozy bed appeared. "Time for sleep, Rocket Max," he said. He lay down, closed his eyes.

"Goodnight, stars," Max whispered. "Goodnight, planets. Goodnight, moon. Goodnight, Rocket Max."

End.
