In the forest, Max found a map. It had paths and bridges. He jumped on his bike.

First bridge was wooden, old. Max crossed it fast. What do you think happened next?

Suddenly, a tree fell! Max swerved. He landed safe. "Phew!" he said.

Next path led to a garden. Colorful flowers bloomed. Max ran, sniffed roses.

Treehouse in the meadow! Max zoomed his bike. It was tall, made of wood.

Up the ladder, Max found gold coins. "Treasure!" he shouted. He counted them.

Suddenly, a bird sang. Max looked up. The sun was setting.

Next, a gentle hill. Max pedaled up. The wind blew through his hair.

At the top, a view of the forest. Max felt calm. He listened to the wind.

The stars twinkled in the sky. Max lay on the grass. He closed his eyes.

Breathing in, he smelled the flowers. Out, he felt the cool night air.

Max felt tired. His adventure was done. He slept peacefully under the stars.
