  "story": "# The Garden at the Edge of Time\n\nMaya had discovered the treehouse by accident, following a narrow path through the woods behind her grandmother's cottage. It wasn't like any treehouse she'd seen before—its walls seemed to shimmer slightly in the late afternoon light, and strange flowers grew from cracks in the wooden planks, their petals glowing faintly purple and gold.\n\nShe climbed the rope ladder, her heart beating with that particular mixture of nervousness and excitement that comes from finding something that feels like it was meant just for you.\n\nInside, the treehouse was bigger than it should have been. A telescope stood by the window, pointing up at the sky even though the sun hadn't set yet. And on a small table, she found a leather journal with a note tucked inside: *\"For the one who loves the stars—look through the telescope when the first star appears. Trust what you see.\"*\n\nMaya waited, watching through the window as the sky shifted from blue to pink to deep violet. When the first star appeared—bright Venus, actually, though she didn't know that—she pressed her eye to the telescope.\n\nThe world lurched.\n\nSuddenly she was standing in a meadow she'd never seen before, the treehouse gone, replaced by tall grasses that swayed in a warm breeze. But the sky—oh, the sky was impossible. It was still twilight, but the stars were enormous, blazing with colors she didn't have names for, and three moons hung low on the horizon.\n\n\"You're here!\" a voice squeaked.\n\nMaya spun around to find a small dinosaur—no bigger than a rabbit—with feathers of brilliant blue and green, hopping toward her excitedly. It looked like a tiny velociraptor wearing a hummingbird's coat.\n\n\"I'm... sorry, did you just speak?\" Maya asked, wondering if she'd fallen asleep in the treehouse.\n\n\"Of course! I'm Pip. We've been waiting ages for someone to find the telescope.\" The little dinosaur bounced on his hind legs. \"Well, not *ages* ages, but you know, several dinners' worth of time, which feels quite long when you're hungry.\"\n\n\"Where am I?\" Maya looked around the meadow, which rolled gently toward a hill in the distance.\n\n\"The In-Between,\" Pip said matter-of-factly. \"It's where the Stone Age dreams about the future and the future remembers the Stone Age. Time gets a bit tangled here, which is lovely for gardens—things grow from all different eras at once.\"\n\nAs if to prove his point, Maya noticed the meadow was dotted with flowers she recognized—daisies and buttercups—alongside prehistoric ferns and strange crystalline plants that chimed softly in the breeze.\n\n\"Come on!\" Pip chirped. \"Luna's been tending the star garden, and she'll want to meet you.\"\n\nThey followed a winding path up the hill, and Maya noticed other creatures peeking out from the tall grass: a woolly hamster (at least, that's what it looked like), a saber-toothed kitten with oversized fangs it clearly hadn't grown into yet, and a small pterodactyl with fur instead of feathers, hanging upside down from a branch and watching them with curious amber eyes.\n\nAt the top of the hill, they found the garden.\n\nIt was circular, surrounded by standing stones that hummed with a low, peaceful frequency. Inside the circle, flowers grew in spiral patterns, each one glowing softly with its own inner light. And in the center stood a mammoth—but small, only the size of a pony—with silver fur that sparkled like starlight.\n\n\"Luna,\" Pip announced proudly, \"this is the star-watcher!\"\n\nLuna turned, and her eyes were deep and kind. \"Welcome, Maya. We've been growing this garden for someone who understands that plants and stars are not so different—both are ancient lights, both know how to reach.\"\n\n\"How did you know my name?\" Maya asked softly.\n\n\"The telescope knows the names of those who truly see,\" Luna said. \"Now, come. I want to show you something special.\"\n\nLuna led them across a small bridge made of stone and living wood, its railings wound with flowering vines. On the other side, the garden changed. Here, the flowers didn't just glow—they held tiny points of light in their centers, like stars captured in petals.\n\n\"These are memory flowers,\" Luna explained. \"Each one holds a moment when someone looked up at the night sky and felt wonder. When you plant wonder, it grows into friendship—friendship between times, between species, between earth and sky.\"\n\nMaya knelt beside a flower that pulsed with gentle blue light. When she looked closely, she could see something in its center—a scene, like a tiny window. A Stone Age child, sitting by a fire, looking up at the same stars Maya loved, drawing constellations in the dirt with a stick.\n\n\"We're not so different,\" Maya whispered.\n\n\"No,\" Luna agreed. \"The love of beauty and mystery—that's older than any age, and newer than this morning. That's what this garden grows.\"\n\nPip hopped onto Maya's shoulder. \"Will you come back? The garden needs someone from your time to tend it too. Someone who understands both the ancient and the reaching-forward.\"\n\nMaya looked around at the impossible, wonderful garden, at the enormous stars wheeling overhead, at the small creatures who'd welcomed her so warmly. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I'll come back.\"\n\nLuna touched Maya's hand gently with her trunk. \"Then take this.\" She held out a single seed that glowed with soft golden light. \"Plant it in your grandmother's garden. It will bloom in both worlds—a bridge between your time and ours. When you want to visit, you need only touch its petals and look up at the stars.\"\n\nMaya took the seed carefully, feeling its warmth pulse against her palm like a tiny heartbeat.\n\n\"Time to go back now,\" Pip said softly. \"The first star is fading into the company of others.\"\n\nThe meadow began to shimmer, just like the treehouse walls had. Maya felt herself being gently pulled backward, the garden and her new friends growing distant but somehow not gone—just waiting.\n\nShe blinked, and she was back in the treehouse, the telescope still warm under her hand. The sky outside was now fully dark, scattered with ordinary, beautiful stars. In her other hand, the seed still glowed softly.\n\nMaya climbed down from the treehouse and walked back along the path to her grandmother's cottage. In the garden behind the house, she found a perfect spot—where the moonlight fell clearest, where she could see it",
