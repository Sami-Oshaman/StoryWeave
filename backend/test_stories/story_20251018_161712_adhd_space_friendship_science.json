  "story": "# The Rocket Garden\n\nMax saw a rocket in his backyard. It was shiny and silver. \"Wow!\" he said.\n\nThe rocket door opened with a WHOOSH! A robot waved at him. \"Come aboard, Max!\"\n\nMax jumped inside super fast. The controls were glowing bright blue. \"Where are we going?\" he asked.\n\n\"To Mars!\" said the robot. The engines roared to life. They blasted off into space!\n\nStars zoomed past the window. Max felt like Mark Watney. What do you think he saw?\n\nA purple planet appeared ahead. It had rings made of ice. \"Let's land there!\" Max shouted.\n\nThey touched down on soft ground. Max opened the hatch door. He stepped onto an alien world!\n\nA glowing path stretched before him. It sparkled with star dust. \"Follow me,\" said the robot.\n\nThe path led to a crystal bridge. It floated above a purple canyon. Max ran across it carefully.\n\nOn the other side was something amazing. Can you guess what it was? A garden filled with rocket plants!\n\nTiny rockets grew on silver vines. They hummed and glowed softly. \"These are rocket seeds,\" explained the robot.\n\nMax picked one carefully. It felt warm in his hand. \"What does it do?\" he asked.\n\n\"Plant it and see!\" said the robot. Max found good soil quickly. He dug a small hole.\n\nHe planted the rocket seed deep. Water appeared from nowhere. The ground started to shake!\n\nA treehouse shot up from the ground! It had windows shaped like stars. \"Whoa!\" Max climbed up fast.\n\nInside was a telescope. Max looked through it right away. He saw Jupiter up close!\n\nThe Great Red Spot was spinning. Moons orbited all around it. \"This is so cool!\" Max said.\n\nBut waitâ€”something was moving out there. A spaceship was heading their way! Was it friendly or not?\n\nThe ship landed near the treehouse. A door slid open slowly. Out stepped a kid from Mars!\n\n\"Hi! I'm Zara,\" she said. She had silver hair and smiled. \"Want to explore together?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Max climbed down quickly. Zara showed him her jet boots. They both zoomed into the air!\n\nThey flew over a meadow below. It glowed with bioluminescent flowers. The flowers hummed a gentle song.\n\n\"This meadow grows food for astronauts,\" Zara explained. Max landed to touch one. It felt like soft velvet.\n\nThey picked some glowing berries together. The berries tasted like starlight. \"These give you energy,\" said Zara.\n\nMax earned an astronaut badge then. Zara pinned it on his shirt. He felt so proud and happy.\n\n\"One more place to visit,\" Zara said. She pointed to a distant hill. \"The Friendship Observatory is there.\"\n\nThey walked up the hill together. The path was lined with moonflowers. The flowers opened as they passed.\n\nAt the top stood a dome. It was made of clear glass. Inside were thousands of star maps.\n\n\"Every astronaut adds their star here,\" Zara said. She handed Max a glowing marker. \"Choose your own special star.\"\n\nMax found a bright yellow one. He drew a circle around it. \"That's mine now,\" he said softly.\n\nThe robot appeared with warm drinks. They tasted like vanilla and honey. Max sipped his drink slowly.\n\nThey sat on soft cushions together. The dome showed constellations above them. Zara pointed out her favorites.\n\n\"That's Orion,\" she said quietly. \"And there's the Big Dipper.\" Max's eyes grew a bit heavy.\n\nThe stars seemed to twinkle gently. They made patterns in the darkness. Max felt very calm now.\n\n\"Time to go home,\" whispered Zara. She gave Max a hug. \"Come back anytime, friend.\"\n\nMax climbed into his rocket again. The robot started the engines softly. They lifted off very gently.\n\nThe purple planet grew smaller below. Max waved goodbye through the window. His new badge glowed warmly.\n\nThe rocket flew through quiet space. Stars drifted past like snowflakes. Max yawned a big yawn.\n\nEarth appeared ahead, blue and green. His backyard came into view. The rocket landed without a sound.\n\nMax stepped onto his grass. Everything was peaceful and still. The moon shone bright above.\n\nHe looked at his astronaut badge. It still glowed faintly. \"What an amazing adventure,\" he whispered.\n\nMax walked to his house slowly. His bed looked so cozy. He climbed under the soft blankets.\n\nHe closed his eyes gently. He could still see the stars. They twinkled in his dreams.\n\nHis rocket seed was in his pocket. Tomorrow he would plant it. But tonight, he would rest.\n\nMax smiled as he drifted off. He dreamed of space and friendship. Everything was calm and peaceful.\n\nThe stars watched over him kindly. The moon sent gentle light. Max slept deeply and well.\n\nGoodnight, young astronaut. Sleep tight.",
