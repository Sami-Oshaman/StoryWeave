  "story": "First, Luna put on her space helmet. It was blue, just like always.\nThen, she checked her space backpack. Everything was in the right place.\n\nFirst, Luna walked to her rocket. She counted her steps. One, two, three, four, five.\nThen, she climbed inside. She sat in the same seat as always because it felt safe.\n\nFirst, the rocket counted down. Five, four, three, two, one.\nThen, the rocket flew up into space. Luna knew this would happen because rockets always fly up.\n\nIn space, Luna saw the same stars she sees every night. This made her feel calm.\nShe waved to the moon. The moon was round and bright, just like last time.\n\nFinally, Luna flew home. She landed in her bed.\nShe said, \"Goodnight, stars. Goodnight, moon. Goodnight, space.\"\nLuna closed her eyes. Everything was the same and safe. The end.",
