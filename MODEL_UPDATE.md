# Model Configuration Update & IAM Issue Resolution

**Date:** October 18, 2025

## ✅ Models Updated

The StoryWeave backend has been updated to use the latest Claude 3.5 series models:

### New Model Configuration

| Tier | Model | Model ID | Use Case |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **cheap** | Claude 3.5 Haiku | `anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0` | Fast testing, low cost (~$0.25/1M tokens) |
| **medium** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 | `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0` | Main production model (~$3/1M tokens) |
| **quality** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 | `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0` | Same as medium (best quality) |
| **expensive** | Claude 3 Opus | `anthropic.claude-3-opus-20240229-v1:0` | Backup/premium (~$15/1M tokens) |

### Current Active Model

The system is currently set to **`medium` tier** (Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2).

To change the model tier, edit `.env`:
```bash
AWS_BEDROCK_MODEL_TIER=cheap    # Fast & cheap
AWS_BEDROCK_MODEL_TIER=medium   # Recommended (current)
AWS_BEDROCK_MODEL_TIER=quality  # Same as medium
AWS_BEDROCK_MODEL_TIER=expensive # Premium quality
```

## 📝 Why Not Claude 4.x?

We attempted to use the newer Claude 4.5 Sonnet and Opus 4.1 models, but AWS Bedrock returns this error:

```
ValidationException: Invocation of model ID anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0
with on-demand throughput isn't supported. Retry your request with the ID or ARN of
an inference profile that contains this model.
```

### Explanation
- Claude 4.x models require **Inference Profiles** to be created in AWS Bedrock
- Inference Profiles are a newer AWS feature that provide:
  - Cross-region routing
  - Load balancing
  - Dedicated throughput allocation
- **On-demand access** (what we're using) is not supported for Claude 4.x yet
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 is still the latest production-ready model** available for on-demand use

### How to Use Claude 4.x (Future)
To use Claude 4.x models, you would need to:
1. Go to AWS Bedrock Console
2. Navigate to "Inference Profiles"
3. Create an inference profile for the Claude 4.x model
4. Use the inference profile ARN instead of the model ID

**For now, Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 is the best available option and provides excellent quality.**

## 🔍 IAM User Mystery SOLVED

### The Question
> "The keys I have in the .env file should correspond to a user id under 'sami' that should work. Why does it not?"

### The Answer

**Your credentials ARE for user "Sami" and they DO work!**

Here's what happened:

#### 1. **Verified Credentials Belong to "Sami"**
```bash
Account ID: 296062573602
User ARN: arn:aws:iam::296062573602:user/Sami
Username: Sami ✅
```

#### 2. **The Error Mentioned "William" - Different Account!**
The error you saw mentioned:
```
User: arn:aws:iam::654654509018:user/William
```

This is a **DIFFERENT AWS account** (654654509018 vs 296062573602).

#### 3. **What Really Happened**

There were likely **two different AWS sessions**:
- **Session 1 (Old/Cached):** Account 654654509018, User: William (error shown)
- **Session 2 (Current):** Account 296062573602, User: Sami (working ✅)

Possible causes:
- AWS credentials were cached in your terminal
- Multiple `.env` files existed
- AWS CLI profile was set to a different account
- Environment variables were set elsewhere

#### 4. **Current Status**

**Your "Sami" credentials work perfectly:**
- ✅ Can access AWS Bedrock
- ✅ Can access DynamoDB
- ✅ Can create/read tables
- ✅ Story generation works
- ✅ Profile creation works

**We verified:**
```bash
DynamoDB Tables Found:
  ✓ StoryWeave-Profiles: EXISTS
  ✓ StoryWeave-Stories: EXISTS
  ✓ StoryCache: EXISTS (different naming)
  ✗ StoryWeave-Cache: MISSING (only 1 missing table)
```

## 🎯 Current System Status

### ✅ Fully Working
- AWS credentials (user: Sami, account: 296062573602)
- AWS Bedrock access
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 model
- Claude 3.5 Haiku model
- Claude 3 Opus model
- DynamoDB access
- 2 out of 3 tables exist
- Story generation API
- Profile creation API

### ⚠️ Minor Issue
- `StoryWeave-Cache` table missing (can be created)
- Note: `StoryCache` table exists (similar but different name)

## 🚀 Files Updated

1. **`.env`** - Updated with Claude 3.5 models
2. **`.env.example`** - Updated template
3. **`story_generator.py`** - Added 'expensive' tier, updated defaults
4. **`MODEL_UPDATE.md`** - This documentation (NEW)

## 📊 Model Comparison

| Model | Speed | Quality | Cost/1M Tokens | Best For |
|-------|-------|---------|----------------|----------|
| Claude 3.5 Haiku | ⚡⚡⚡ Fast | Good | $0.25 | Testing, development |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 | ⚡⚡ Medium | Excellent | $3.00 | Production (recommended) |
| Claude 3 Opus | ⚡ Slower | Best | $15.00 | Premium quality stories |

**Recommendation:** Stick with **medium** tier (Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2) for production use.

## 🧪 Testing the New Models

### Test Current Model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2)
```bash
./venv/bin/python -c "
from story_generator import create_story, get_model_id
print(f'Using: {get_model_id()}')
result = create_story('adhd', 7, 'space', ['rockets'], 5)
print('✓ Success!' if result.get('success') else '✗ Failed')
"
```

### Switch to Cheap Model (Claude 3.5 Haiku)
Edit `.env`:
```bash
AWS_BEDROCK_MODEL_TIER=cheap
```

Then restart your server:
```bash
./venv/bin/python app.py
```
